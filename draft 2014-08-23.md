DECISION MAKING BY THE MEMBERS
==============================

General Meetings

33 The board must arrange a meeting of members (an annual general meeting
or “AGM”) in the month of April each calendar year.
34 The business of each AGM must include:
34.1 a report by the chair on the activities of the Hacklab;
34.2 consideration of the annual accounts of the Hacklab; and
34.3 the election/re-election of directors, as referred to in clauses 63 to 65.
35 The board may arrange an extraordinary general meeting at any time.

Power to request the board to arrange a extraordinary general meeting (EGM)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
36 The board must arrange an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) if they
are requested to do so by a notice (which may take the form of two or
more documents in the same terms, each signed by one or more members)
by members who amount to 20% or more of the total membership of the
Hacklab at the time, or 5 members which ever is greater providing:
36.1 the notice states the purposes for which the meeting is to be held; and
36.2 those purposes are not inconsistent with the terms of these articles, the
Companies Act 2006 or any other statutory provision.
37 If the board receives a notice under clause 36, the date for the meeting
which they arrange in accordance with the notice must not be later than
28 days from the date on which they received the notice.

Notice of general meetings
--------------------------
38 At least 14 clear days notice must be given of any AGM or any EGM.
39 The reference to “clear days” in clause 38 shall be taken to mean that, in
calculating the days of notice,
39.1 the day after the notices are posted (or sent by e-mail) should be ex-
cluded; and
39.2 the day of the meeting itself should also be excluded.
40 The notice calling the meeting must specify in general terms what business
is to be dealt with at the meeting; and
40.1 in the case of a resolution to alter the articles, must set out the exact
terms of the proposed alteration(s); or
40.2 in the case of any other resolution falling within clause 49 (require-
ment for a two-thirds majority) must set out the exact terms of the
resolution.
41 Notice of every AGM and EGM must be given to all members and direc-
tors of the Hacklab, but the accidental omission to give notice to one or
more members will not invalidate the proceedings at the meeting
42 Any notice which requires to be given to a member under these articles
must be sent by e-mail to the member, at the e-mail address kept on the
register of members.

Procedure at AGMs and EGMs
--------------------------
43 No valid decisions can be taken at any AGM or EGM unless a quorum is
present.
44 The quorum for a general meeting is 5 members or one quarter of the
membership at the time of the meeting, whichever is fewer.
45 If quorum is not present within 15 minutes after the time at which a gen-
eral meeting was due to start - or if a quorum ceases to be present during a
general meeting - the meeting cannot proceed; and fresh notices of a new
general meeting must be sent out, to deal with the business (or remaining
business) which was intended to be conducted.
46 A director should act as the chairperson of each general meeting.

Voting at general meetings
--------------------------
42 Any notice which requires to be given to a member under these articles
must be sent by e-mail to the member, at the e-mail address kept on the
register of members.

Voting at general meetings
47 Every member has one vote, which can be given personally or by proxy.
48 All binary decisions at general meetings will be made by majority vote -
with the exception of the types of resolution listed in clause 49. For other
decisions the chairperson will decide how the vote is to be conducted.
49 The following resolutions will be valid only if passed by not less that two-
thirds of those voting on the resolution at an AGM or EGM (or if passed
by way of a written resolution under clause 55):
49.1 a resolution amending the articles;
49.2 a resolution expelling a person from membership under clause 30;
49.3 a resolution directing the board to take any particular step (or direct-
ing the board not to take any particular step);
49.4 a resolution for the winding up or dissolution of the Hacklab.
50 If there is an equal number of votes for and against any resolution, the
chairperson of the meeting will be entitled to a second (casting) vote.
51 A resolution put to the vote at a general meeting will be decided on a show
of hands - unless the chair (or at least two other members present at the
meeting) ask for a secret ballot.
52 The chairperson will decide how any secret ballot is to be conducted, and
he/she will declare the result of the ballot at the meeting.
53 Proxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in writing (a “proxy
notice”) which
53.1 states the name and address of the member appointing the proxy;
53.2 identifies the person appointed to be that member’s proxy and the
general meeting inrelation to which that person is appointed;
53.3 is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is
authenticated in such manner as the directors may determine; and
53.4 is delivered to the company in accordance with the articles and any
instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to which
they relate.
53.5 The company may require proxy notices to be delivered in a particular
form, and may specify different forms for different purposes.
53.6 Proxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is
to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more
resolutions.
53.7 Unless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as:
53.7.1 allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to
how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the
meeting, and
53.7.2 appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment
of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting
itself.
54 Delivery of proxy notices
54.1 A person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of
hands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy
notice has been delivered to the company by or on behalf of that per-
son.
54.2 An appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering
to the company a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the person
by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given.
54.3 A notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if it is deliv-
ered before the start of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it
relates.
54.4 If a proxy notice is not executed by the person appointing the proxy,
it must be accompanied by written evidence of the authority of the
person who executed it to execute it on the appointor’s behalf.

Written resolutions by members
------------------------------
55 A resolution agreed to in writing (or by e-mail) by all the members will
be as valid as if it had been passed at a general meeting; the date of the
resolution will be taken to be the date on which the last member agreed to
it.

Minutes
-------
56 The board must ensure that proper minutes are kept in relation to all gen-
eral meetings.

Directors - general duties
--------------------------
73 Each of the directors has a duty, in exercising functions as a director, to act
in the interests of the Hacklab; and in particular, must:
73.1 seek, in good faith, to ensure that the Hacklab acts in a manner which
is in accordance with its purposes;
73.2 act with the care and diligence which it is reasonable to expect of a

between the Hacklab and any other party:

gard to the matter in question;

74.1 that any breach of any of those duties by director is corrected by the
director concerned and not repeated; and
74.2 that any director who has been in serious and persistent breach of
those duties is removed as a director.
75 Provided he/she has declared his/her interest - and has not voted on the
question of whether or not the Hacklab should enter into the arrangement

Hacklab in which he/she has a personal interest and he/she may retain
any personal benefit which arises from that arrangement.

directors under the Companies Act 2006; and all relevant provisions of
this consitution shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with the
provisions of the code of conduct in force from time to time.

DECISION-MAKING BY THE DIRECTORS
================================

Notice of board meetings
------------------------
79 Any director may call a meeting of the board.
80 At least 7 days’ notice must be given of each board meeting, unless (in
the opinion of the person calling the meeting) there is a degree of urgency
which makes that inappropriate.

Procedure at board meetings
---------------------------
81 No valid decisions can be taken at a board meeting unless a quorum is
present; the quorum for board meetings is 3 directors, present in person.
82 If at any time the number of directors in office falls below the number
stated as the quorum in clause 81, the remaining directors will have power
to call an EGM - but will not be able to take any other valid decisions.
83 At each board meeting, the directors present must elect (from amongst
themselves) the person who will act as chairperson of that meeting.
84 Each directors has one vote, which must be given in person.
85 All decisions at board meetings will be made by majority vote.
86 If there is an equal number of votes for and against any resolution, the
chairperson of the meeting will be entitled to a second (casting) vote.
87 The board may, at its discretion, allow any person to attend and speak at
a board meeting notwithstanding that he/she is not a director - but on the
basis that he/she must not participate in decision-making.
88 A director must not vote at a board meeting (or at a meeting of a sub-
committee) on any resolution which relates to a matter in which he/she
has a personal interest or duty which conflicts (or may conflict) with the
interests of the Hacklab; he/she must withdraw from the meeting while
an item of that nature is being dealt with.
89 For the purposes of clause 88: a director will be deemed to have a personal
interest in relation to a particular matter if a body in relation to which
he/she is an employee, director, member of the management committee,
officer or elected representative has an interest in that matter.

Minutes
-------
90 The board must ensure that proper minutes are kept in relation to all board
meetings and meetings of sub-committees.
91 The minutes to be kept under clause 90 must include the names of those
present; and (so far as possible) should be signed by the chairperson of the
meeting. They must be circulated to all members by email within 30 days
of the board meeting

Administration
==============

Delegation to sub-committees
----------------------------
92 The board may delegate any of their powers to sub-committees; a sub-
committee must include at least one director, but other members of a sub-
committee need not be directors.
93 When delegating powers under clause 92, the board must set out appro-
priate conditions (which must include an obligation to report regularly to
the board).
94 Any delegation of powers under clause 92 may be revoked or altered by
the board at any time.
95 The rules of procedure for each sub-committee, and the provisions relating
to membership of each sub-committee, shall be set by the board.

Operation of accounts
---------------------
96 Three account signatories will be appointed by the board; these must them-
selves all be directors.
97 Subject to clause 98, the signatures of one out of three signatories will be
required in relation to all operations (other than the lodging of funds) on
the bank and building society accounts held by the Hacklab.
98 Where the Hacklab uses electronic facilities for the operation of any bank
or building society account, the authorisations required for operations on
that account must be consistent with the approach reflected in clause 97.

Accounting records and annual accounts
--------------------------------------
99 The board must ensure that proper accounting records are kept, in accor-
dance with all applicable statutory requirements.
100 The board must prepare annual accounts, complying with all relevant
statutory requirements.

Miscellaneous
=============

Winding-up
----------
101 Any surplus assets available to the Hacklab immediately preceding its
winding up or dissolution must be used for purposes which are the same
as - or which closely resemble - the purposes of the Hacklab as set out in
these articles.

Alterations to the articles
---------------------------
102 These articles may be altered by resolution of the members passed at an
AGM or EGM (subject to achieving the two-thirds majority referred to in
clause 49) or by way of a written resolution of the members.
